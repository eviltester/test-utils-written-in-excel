Testing Utilities written in Excel.

I used to regularly finding myself working on client sites where their machines were locked down and you couldn't install any software on them.

Fortunately the machines usually came with Excel. And since Excel allowed coding in VBA, I would write my own tools to help me.

This spreadsheet contains some of the code I used to use:
- generating counterstrings
- generating random strings
- generating files of certain length with random data
- locking files
- doing a file compare using the dos FC command
- opening command propmts

I haven't used it in years, but the code might be useful to someone.

It uses macros, so check out the code before you use it, so that you are happy with what it does.
